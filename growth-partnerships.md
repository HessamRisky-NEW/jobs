# Growth & Partnerships Lead

Context is hiring a Growth & Partnerships Lead to accelerate our flagship
product, [mint.fun](http://mint.fun).

This role is remote for people in North American time zones only. If you are
based in SF and prefer in person, we're happy to offer flexible remote/in person
work.

### mint.fun

[mint.fun](http://Mint.fun) is the first and leading NFT primary market
aggregator. A kind of "Reddit of web3," [mint.fun](http://mint.fun) is the
easiest way to discover what new NFT projects are trending and mint them from a
single interface.

### Context

Context builds web3 products we wish existed. We're an early stage startup
that's raised $19,500,000 from investors like [Variant](https://variant.fund/),
[Dragonfly](https://dragonfly.xyz/), and [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama)
to build the future of human readable web3.

### This role

We're looking for someone to help us:

- Activate new users through thoughtful and creative campaigns
- Reach out to creators to partner on launches
- Run social channels like Telegram, Twitter, Farcaster
- Collaborate with other web3 companies on strategic partnerships
- Engage web3 influencers, including cross promotional campaigns
- Interact with our community, hosting Twitter spaces as we grow our flagship
  marketing project, !fundrop
- Help define growth/partnership KPIs and new product features

What we're looking for:

- Experience in growth, marketing, and partnerships, particularly in the web3
  space
- Strong communication and relationship-building skills
- Ability to work independently and as part of a team
- Experience managing social media channels and engaging with online communities

### Benefits and compensation

For this role, we're offering a salary range of $125-175K + generous equity. We
also have benefits such as:

- Fully covered dental & health insurance for you and dependents
- Quarterly off-sites with the team, including one "fun" offsite per year
- A hybrid/flex remote culture. Come into the SF office if you want to, or work
  remotely

### Applying and our process

To get started, please email
[growth-job@context.wtf](mailto:growth-job@context.wtf) with a brief
introduction and any relevant experience, including examples of previous
partnerships and growth initiatives.

Once we get a chance to review your application, we'll move to a phone interview
where we can discuss your background, work, and what you want in a job. You'll
have the opportunity to ask any questions about Context, of course.

From there, we're flexible about how to move forward. For candidates we're
excited about, we can either offer you a paid contracting role or move to a full
time offer. It can be nice to have a full blown work trial, but we understand
that might not work for everyone.

If you have any questions or feedback about this process, please ask!
