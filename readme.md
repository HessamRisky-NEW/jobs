# Context

Context is a company formed with the goal of making web3 more human.

We build [mint.fun](https://mint.fun). [mint.fun](https://mint.fun) simplifies
discovering and minting new NFTs by turning smart contracts into beautiful
interfaces that make Ethereum more accessible to everyone.

Our small but passionate team is committed to delivering thoughtful products
through rigorous engineering. Weâ€™ve raised $19,500,000 from
[Variant](https://variant.fund), [Sam Altman](https://twitter.com/sama), and
[Dragonfly](https://dragonfly.xyz) to create the best web3 products possible.
